# $E_7$

This is the application for type $E_7$.

In "E7.ipynb", there are the out-puts which are already ran.

If you want to run and check the results, you may need to change the directory of __pickle files__ in the codes (or you just put __E7.ipynb__ in __Data__ folder).



The out-puts are:

```python
print("number of components")
print("number of orbit")
print("number of vtx of coset ver.")
print("number of vtx of vtx elimination")
print("vtx elimination of this type is pure : True or False")
print("f-vector of vtx elimination")
print("Betti number")
```



In __Data__ folder, there are __pickle__ files which are the results of codes for a convenience :

__simiplices of E7 of type {} coset ver.pkl__

__simplices of E7 of type {} vtx elimination ver.pkl__
