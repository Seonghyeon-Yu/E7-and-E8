These are for checking of correctness of our codes.

The known results for types $G_2$, $F_4$ and $E_6$ can be found in our paper.



The results from our codes are as follows :

# $G_2$

```{python}
not connected : number of components are 4
Number of orbit : 3
Number of vtx of coset ver. : 8
Type 1 is pure : True
f-vector : [1, 2, 1]
Betti number : {0: 1, 1: 0}
```
