# $G_2$

This is the application for type $G_2$.

For type $G_2$, each components of Ks have only 2 vertices and 1 edge.

Hence, the vertex elimination is not working on type G2.

In __"G2.ipynb"__, there are the out-puts which are already ran.

__G2.ipynb__ file is on __SageMath 9.3 notebook__

If you want to run and check the results, you may need to change the directory of __pickle files__ in the codes.



The out-puts are:

```python
print("number of components")
print("number of orbit")
print("number of vtx of coset ver.")
print("this type is pure : True or False")
print("f-vector")
print("Betti number")
```
